# AutoExecSRB2
A simple C++ script for Sonic Robo Blast 2 that can take a folder of addons and generate an autoexec.cfg file for them. Made primarily for Steam Deck.
This probably won't be useful to many people, but it's a nice little niche thing to help me get the hang of C++ cross platform console apps, which I hope is useful to somebody.

# How to use
Not much to it really, Windows and Ubuntu versions are provided. Simply drop it into the Addons folder and it will generate an AutoExec.cfg file for all files in the directory when run. Does not work on subfolders by design - I wanted this to be made primarily for characters, so that I could optionally enable maps when I wanted to play them on my Steam Deck.
